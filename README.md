# NASS - Not A Static Site *(Generator)*

A somewhat simple website template made in PHP, to make certain things like the
nav-bar and header/footer easier to maintain.

*"Not the National Agricultual Stastiss Service"*
*"Because HUGO is too simple."*

# Programming 'Rules'.

## LLMs (*AI*)

If you so wish to use a LLM to look for errors, find the correct tag, search a
large document, etc... That is fine. But if you *'vibe coded'* something, by
just asking an *AI* to generate it for you, **DO NOT** commit that code to this
project.
